## 1. Purpose

Stardew Valley Data Management is my personal mod that I use to log every event in a Stardew Valley playthrough. While this mod has little to no public application, I wanted to make the repository public because I believe it is a great example on how to use SMAPI to mod Stardew Valley. This mod records any event or milestone that would constitute a 100% playthrough, so nearly every aspect of the game is covered. If you have any questions on my design choices or how SMAPI works, feel free to email me at livmaresh@gmail.com. Happy modding! :3
